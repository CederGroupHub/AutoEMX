Tutorial: Quantify the extent of intermixing in precursor powders
========================================================================

When mixing two powder precursors together, use EDS to evaluate the extent of
their spatial intermixing, known to affect solid-state reactions and the final
impurity content.

`AutoEMX` offers a method to quantify the extent of intermixing, helping the
rationalization of impurity formation in solid-state reactions.
See for example Fig. 6 in:

    Chem. Mater. 2025, 37, 6807−6822 (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.5c01573)

Currently, only intermixing between two precursors species is supported. The
code is however extensible to multi-precursor mixes, and contributions on this
topic are welcome.
      
Output
-------------------

**The procedure to measure the extent of particle intermixing is analogous to 
the standard AutoEMX EDS compositional analysis workflow**, except for a 
couple of small differences:

- To enhance compositional measurement accuracy, given that the analysed material
  is known, `AutoEMX` uses standard reference values for EDS
  quantification that have been collected from the individual precursor
  chemistries, if available. If not available, the regular P/B reference
  values are used instead.

- In the ``Analysis`` folder, the output will include a violin plot showing the
  distribution of molar fractions (`x`) of the two precursors measured with each EDS
  spot spectrum, such as the example below.

The distribution and the standard deviation (σ) of measured molar fractions will
give a sense of how well intermixed are the precursors. Two well-mixed
precursors will lead to a very tight standard deviation around the precursor
molar ratio at which they have been mixed (1:1 in the image above). 
Typically, σ~5 indicates very well mixed precursors.
   
Always keep in mind that the EDS X-ray generation volume has a finite size,
below which the intermixing cannot be evaluated.
For example, supposing a 1-um generation depth, atomically intermixed species
will yield very similar measurements as intermixed nanoscale regions, resulting
for example from spinoidal decomposition.
Use the Kanaya-Okayama equation to estimate the X-ray generation depth.


Workflow
-------------------

Step 1 - Measure Precursor Standards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note that **this step is not essential**, but will genearlly contribute to an 
improved compositional measurement accuracy.

Follow the :ref:`Experimental Standards Measurement Tutorial <advanced_new_exp_stds>`
to create standard reference values for each powder material that you'll want
to mix and measure.
 
The only difference is that you should set
``powder_meas_cfg_kwargs.is_known_powder_mixture_meas = True``.
This will trigger two configurations:

- ``exp_stds_meas_cfg_kwargs.use_for_mean_PB_calc = False``; this prevents
  the P/B values measured on particles being used for regular quantification,
  which should preferably employ reference P/B values acquired from bulk samples.

- ``exp_stds_meas_cfg_kwargs.generate_separate_std_dict = True``; this creates
  a new standard file for a set of precursor mix measurements for a specific
  project, and saves it in ``exp_std_dir``. If ``exp_std_dir`` is left to ``None``,
  the default path will be used (i.e., ``autoemx/Std_measurements``).
 
Once all standards are measured, copy the ``EDS_Stds_{beam-energy}keV.json`` 
file from ``exp_std_dir`` to the project folder, defined
through ``results_dir`` in the scripts employed in Step 2.

Note that you may try skipping this step, and directly go to Step 2.
If unsatisfied with the quantification results, you can go back to Step 1, and
successivelly re-quantify the spectra acquired in Step 2 following
:ref:`Step 8 in this Tutorial <comp_analysis_tutorial>`.

Step 2 - Run Acquisition & Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Follow the instructions from the :ref:`Compositional Characterization Tutorial <comp_analysis_tutorial>`.

The only differences are that, when preparing the acquisition script (i.e.,
``Run_Acquisition_Quant_Analysis.py``), you should:

- As a list of candidate phases, provide **only** the two compositions that are
  intermixed, (as values for the ``cnd`` key in ``samples``).
- Set ``use_project_specific_std_dict = True`` to use the standard reference
  dictionary saved in the project folder, defined in ``results_dir``.
  If not found, it will use the default standard reference values.
- Set ``powder_meas_cfg_kwargs.is_known_powder_mixture_meas = True``. This
  option tells `AutoEMX` to use reference P/B values obtained from the known
  powder compositions, instead of the `Mean` of reference values measured also
  from other chemistries. Note that you can always turn off this option later
  when quantifying the spectra in ``Run_Quantification_Analysis.py``, setting
  ``is_known_precursor_mixture = False`` and passing this option to
  ``batch_quantify_and_analyze()``. In this case, `AutoEMX` will use
  the P/B reference values commonly employed during regular compositional
  characterization of unknown sample chemistries for phase identification.
