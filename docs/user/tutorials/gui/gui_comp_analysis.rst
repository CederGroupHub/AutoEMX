Tutorial: EDS compositional analysis for phase identification in the GUI
========================================================================

This tutorial shows how to run the automated workflow for EDS compositional analysis in the
AutoEMX GUI. It is the GUI equivalent of :ref:`comp_analysis_tutorial`, which uses the
``Run_Acquisition.py``, ``Run_Quantification.py`` and ``Run_Analysis.py`` scripts.

The workflow is described in Giunto *et al.*, *Nature Communications* **17**, 9735 (2026)
(https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-76633-x), and includes:

- Acquisition of EDS spectra from powder or bulk samples (**Acquisition** tab)
- Fitting and quantification to extract compositions (**Quantification** tab, or during
  acquisition)
- Rule-based filtering of compositions, and clustering analysis to detect the number of phases
  and extract their compositions (**Analysis** tab, or right after quantification)

Several samples can be acquired and quantified one after the other with a *single click*.

If you have not opened the GUI yet, start with :ref:`gui_getting_started_tutorial`. To analyse
spectra acquired without AutoEMX, import them first as described in
:ref:`gui_fit_spectra_tutorial` (*Fit and quantify many spectra*), then continue from Step 7.


Step 1 - Open the Acquisition tab
---------------------------------

Open the GUI on the microscope computer and choose the results folder of your project at the
top. The **Acquisition** tab shows whether the microscope API (e.g. PyPhenom for the Phenom XL)
is available; the GUI opens on this tab when it is.

In the **Microscope** section, select the microscope (PhenomXL by default). It sets the driver,
the calibrations and the P/B standards used for the quantification. The chips above the form
show whether the microscope is connected and whether P/B standards exist at the chosen beam
energy. **Quantifiable elements** shows the periodic table of the elements with standards.

   The Acquisition tab, with one sample to acquire (K-412) and its settings. On this computer the
   microscope API is not installed, as the status chip at the top shows.

Step 2 - Define the samples to analyse
--------------------------------------

In **Samples to acquire**, add one row per sample (**Add sample**; ⧉ copies a row, × deletes
one):

- **ID**: sample identifier. All data are saved in the results folder, under a folder named
  after the ID. Acquiring a sample that already exists adds spectra to it (Step 8).
- **Elements**: elements quantified from the EDS spectra. Do **not** include elements present
  only in the substrate (e.g. C from carbon tape); these are set in **Sample & Holder**. Avoid
  light elements dominant in the substrate even if present in the sample (e.g. C from carbonates
  on carbon tape), as this may disrupt quantification and lead to large analytical errors. In
  general, avoid element overlap between substrate and sample. Elements without a P/B standard
  are flagged below the table.
- **x, y**: sample centre position in absolute stage coordinates (mm), typically obtained from
  *Saved Positions* at the microscope.
- **Candidate phases** (optional): compositions that may be present, e.g. ``MgO, Al2O3``. They
  can be changed later when re-running the analysis.

In **Sample & Holder**, set the parameters common to all samples:

- **sample type**: ``powder``, ``bulk``, ``powder_continuous`` or ``bulk_rough``
- **sample half-width**: half-width of the sample region to analyse (mm)
- **substrate** (``Ctape`` or ``None``), **substrate elements** (e.g. ``C, O, Al`` for carbon
  tape on an Al stub), **substrate shape** (``circle`` or ``square``) and **substrate width**
  (SEM stub diameter, mm)
- **detect carbon tape automatically**: currently supported only for carbon tape that appears
  dark on a brighter stub (e.g. Al). Allows to be tolerant to off-centred sticking of the tape.
- **working distance**: approximate working distance (mm). Autofocus is limited to
  **working distance tolerance** around this value, to avoid large focusing errors.

The settings and the sample list are kept in the browser between sessions; **Reset to
defaults** restores the defaults of the script.


Step 3 - Define the measurement settings
----------------------------------------

In **Acquisition**:

- **beam energy (keV)**: a P/B standards file must exist for this voltage (see the status chip).
- **target counts per spectrum**.
- **max acquisition time (s)**: maximum acquisition time per spectrum, after which the
  acquisition is interrupted and the spectrum discarded.
- **manual navigation**: manually navigate to the region of interest. Typically off, unless you
  want to analyse a specific region of the sample.
- **automatic brightness/contrast**: typically on. When off, set **contrast** and
  **brightness**.
- **number of spectra**, or **min spectra** and **max spectra** when quantifying during
  acquisition (Step 4).

.. warning::

   **max acquisition time** should be set as a function of the detector counts/sec, so that
   the acquisition is interrupted only when wrong regions are selected (e.g. carbon tape or a
   void in the sample instead of a particle). Spectra interrupted due to this parameter are
   flagged (``quant_flag = 2``) and discarded. Make sure it is high enough for your EDS system.

In **Images**: image format, and whether particle images are annotated with the positions of the
spectra (by default they are saved raw: the Analysis tab shows the positions anyway).


Step 4 - Quantify spectra during acquisition
--------------------------------------------

Tick **quantify during acquisition** to quantify spectra while they are acquired. Quantification
is parallelised but may be slow on less powerful microscope computers; in this case, leave it
off and quantify the spectra afterwards in the Quantification tab (Step 9), possibly on
another computer.

When on, AutoEMX periodically checks for convergence and may stop the acquisition early,
between **min spectra** and **max spectra**:

- If no candidate phases are assigned: all clusters must have RMS point-to-centroid distance
  < 2.5%.
- If candidate phases are assigned: confidence score > 0.8 and RMS point-to-centroid distance
  < 3%.


Step 5 - Define other parameters
--------------------------------

The **Quantification** section of the Acquisition tab is used when quantifying during
acquisition. These settings can also be changed later in the Quantification tab, but require
re-quantification:

- **interrupt fits of bad spectra**: interrupt the quantification of spectra expected to lead to
  large errors. Typically on, to speed up quantification.
- **min background counts**: minimum counts required under a reference peak. Spectra failing
  this criterion are flagged (``quant_flag = 8``). If too many spectra are flagged, decrease it
  or increase the target counts in your following measurements.
- **project-specific standards**: use the P/B standards file saved in the results folder.

These only require re-analysis (Analysis tab):

- **max analytical error (w%)**: compositions with a larger analytical error are discarded from
  the clustering.
- **accepted quant flags**: flags considered valid in the clustering (see :ref:`quant_flags`).
- **max clusters**: maximum number of clusters; 6 is generally sufficient for materials science
  samples.
- **show discarded compositions**: show compositions discarded from the clustering in the
  plots. Even if discarded because of their analytical error, they can hint at the phases
  present in the sample.


Step 6 - Sample-type-specific settings
--------------------------------------

Depending on the sample type, set the **Powder acquisition params** (detection of particles and
choice of the EDS spots on them) or the **Bulk grid acquisition params** (grid of EDS spots for
``bulk``, ``bulk_rough`` and ``powder_continuous``). The section that does not apply is greyed
out. See :class:`PowderMeasurementConfig <autoemx.config.runtime_configs.PowderMeasurementConfig>`
and :class:`BulkMeasurementConfig <autoemx.config.runtime_configs.BulkMeasurementConfig>` for
details; the **?** next to each field describes it.


Step 7 - Launch spectra acquisition
-----------------------------------

**Start acquisition** asks for confirmation, then acquires the samples one after the other,
with a progress bar per sample and the log. With manual navigation or manual particle
selection, a window asks you to centre each spot or particle. **Stop** interrupts the
acquisition, keeping the spectra already acquired; the microscope is left in its current state.
When the acquisition ends, the results folder is rescanned and the new samples appear in the
other tabs.

**Save as script…** downloads a Python script running the same acquisition, e.g. to run it on
the microscope computer without the GUI.

The sample folders contain the same output as with the script: SEM images, spectra and
``ledger.json`` (see *Output* in :ref:`comp_analysis_tutorial`).


Step 8 - Optional: (re)acquire spectra
--------------------------------------

You can restart an interrupted acquisition, or acquire more spectra after inspecting the first
results: start the acquisition again with the same sample ID. AutoEMX resumes from the next
available spectrum and particle IDs. See *Restarting acquisition* in
:ref:`comp_analysis_tutorial` for how existing spectra are handled.


Step 9 - Optional: (re)quantify spectra
---------------------------------------

This step is done automatically if you quantified during acquisition. Otherwise, or to
quantify again with other settings, use the **Quantification** tab, on the microscope computer
or on a more performant one (e.g. with more CPU cores) with access to the results folder.

1. **Tick the samples to quantify** in the table. All samples start unticked, so you can
   quantify only the samples just added to a project. Sort the table by clicking a column
   header, e.g. **Acquired** to show the latest samples first, and filter it by typing in the
   row below the headers. **Select/Unselect all** ticks (or unticks) all the samples listed.
2. **Elements.** The sample and substrate elements of each sample can be edited in the table.
   Unchanged elements keep the values saved in the sample's ledger.
3. **Settings.** Options left empty (or set to *saved*) keep each sample's saved value. When the
   ticked samples share the same saved value, it is shown in grey in the empty field (and as
   e.g. *saved (no)* in the menus); *saved* means that their values differ.
   *Which spectra*: interrupt fits of bad spectra, **force requantification** (new
   quantification run), **re-quantify only unquantified spectra** (e.g. after lowering the
   minimum background counts), and **max spectra per sample** to quantify only the first N
   spectra, e.g. for a quick test. **CPU cores**: number of cores used in parallel (half of the
   available cores by default). **Run analysis afterwards** (on by default) runs the
   clustering analysis right after the quantification.
4. **Quantify and analyse selected samples** (or **Quantify selected samples**). The samples
   are quantified one after the other, in the order of the table, with a progress bar per sample
   and the log. Cancelling keeps the spectra already quantified.

   :align: center

   The Quantification tab, with the K-412 sample ticked. Below the table, its quantification runs and the
   quant flags of the active run.

Click a sample in the table to show its quantification runs (settings, number of quantified
spectra, quant flags; see :ref:`quant_flags`) and the flags of its active run.
**Analyse this sample →** opens it in the Analysis tab.


Step 10 - Optional: (re)analyse spectra
---------------------------------------

This step is done automatically if you quantified during acquisition, or with **Run analysis
afterwards**. To run the analysis again with other parameters, open the **Analysis** tab.

1. **Select a sample** at the top. The sidebar shows its elements, substrate, number of spectra
   and of quantified spectra. The latest (active) analysis is shown.
2. **Set the parameters.** The form contains every clustering parameter, filled in with the
   values saved in the sample's ledger. Parameters not used with the current settings are
   greyed out. **Load settings of shown analysis** fills the form with the settings of the
   analysis selected above the plot.

   - *Spectra filtering*: maximum analytical error and accepted quant flags.
   - *Clustering*: method (k-means or DBSCAN), geometry (euclidean, Aitchison or auto; see
     :ref:`clustering_modes`), features (atomic or mass fractions), number of clusters (empty =
     found automatically, with the chosen method), **candidate phases**, and mixture
     decomposition.
   - *DBSCAN*, *Aitchison geometry*, *Cluster merging*, *Mixture decomposition*: all their
     parameters (see :ref:`mixture_decomposition` and the mixture options in
     :ref:`comp_analysis_tutorial`).
   - *Plot output*: options of the PNG figures saved in the analysis folder (elements on the
     axes or excluded from the plot, discarded compositions, custom plots).

3. **Run analysis.** The analysis runs in the background (a few seconds) and can be cancelled.
   Results are saved to the ledger and to an ``analysis_quant<i>_clust<j>`` folder, exactly as
   with the script.
4. **Explore the results.**

   - *Clustering*: 3D, ternary (3 elements, normalised) or 2D plot of the compositions, with
     clusters, ±1σ ellipsoids, centroids, candidate phases and the best mixture of each cluster
     (shown when its confidence is at least **mix. conf**). Choose the elements on each axis,
     colour the spectra by cluster, analytical error, particle, quant flag or R², and toggle each
     layer. Rotate and zoom with the mouse; click legend entries to hide them.
     **Save plot as HTML** saves the interactive plot in the analysis folder.
   - *Clusters*: composition ± standard deviation of each cluster, candidate phases and
     mixtures with their confidence and molar fractions (the content of ``Clusters.csv``).
   - *Spectra*: table of all spectra, sortable and filterable.
   - *Distributions*: fraction of each element by cluster.
   - *SEM images* (named after the microscope type): the image of the particle (or frame) where
     the selected spectrum was collected, with all spectrum spots marked and coloured by
     cluster (click a spot to select its spectrum). ◀ / ▶ step through the images, which are
     also shown in a strip below, sorted by particle number.
   - *Saved figures* and *Settings used*: the PNG figures and ``Analysis_config_summary.txt``
     of the analysis.

5. **Inspect single spectra.** Click a point in the plot, a row of the table or a point of the
   distributions to show the spectrum and its composition on the right; ◀ / ▶ browse through
   the spectra. **Show in SEM image** opens the image where it was collected, with its spot
   highlighted. **Fit spectrum** re-fits it (about 10 s) to show the fitted model, the
   background and the background counts under the reference peaks. **Open in Single
   spectrum** opens it in the Single spectrum tab, to fit it with other settings (see
   :ref:`gui_fit_spectra_tutorial`).

Previous analyses of a sample can be selected in the **Analysis** menu above the plot.


Quantify the extent of intermixing in precursor powders
-------------------------------------------------------

The GUI also runs the workflow of :ref:`precursor_mix_tutorial`, which follows the steps above
with these differences:

- In Step 2, give **only** the two intermixed compositions as candidate phases.
- In Step 5, tick **project-specific standards** to use the standards of the precursors saved in
  the results folder (see Step 1 of :ref:`precursor_mix_tutorial`); without them, the default
  standards are used.
- In Step 6, tick **is known powder mixture measurement** in the powder acquisition parameters.
  It can be changed later with **known precursor mixture** in the Quantification tab.

The violin plots of the molar fractions of the precursors appear under *Saved figures* in the
Analysis tab.
