Tutorial: Get started with the AutoEMX GUI
==========================================

The AutoEMX GUI lets you run all of AutoEMX by pointing and clicking: acquire spectra with the
microscope, quantify them, identify the phases of your samples with the clustering analysis and
explore the results in interactive 3D plots, and fit single spectra. It runs the same engine as
the scripts and reads and writes the same sample folders, so you can switch between the GUI and
the scripts at any time.

It runs **locally**: a small server on your computer (``127.0.0.1``) shows the interface in
your browser. It reads and writes the sample folders on your disk, and nothing is uploaded
anywhere.

.. note::

   **Try it online.** A public demo of the single-spectrum fit and quantification, with no
   installation, is at https://autoemx-singlespectrum.streamlit.app. It is a demo only: slow,
   it may need to wake up, it accepts a limited number of files, and it uses the PhenomXL
   standards at 15 kV.


Step 1 - Create the AutoEMX app (once)
--------------------------------------

In a terminal, in the Python environment where AutoEMX is installed
(see :doc:`../../installation`), run::

   python -m autoemx.gui --create-launcher

This writes an **AutoEMX** launcher on your Desktop (``AutoEMX.command`` on macOS, shown with the
AutoEMX icon and without its extension; ``AutoEMX.bat`` on Windows; ``AutoEMX.sh`` on Linux),
replacing a launcher created by an earlier version (``AutoEMX GUI``). From then on,
**double-click it to open the GUI**, without a terminal. It runs the GUI with the Python
environment used to create it, so run the command again if you change environment.

Options: add a results folder to open it directly
(``python -m autoemx.gui path/to/Results --create-launcher``), or a destination folder after
``--create-launcher`` to write the launcher elsewhere.


Step 2 - Launch the GUI
-----------------------

Double-click **AutoEMX** on your Desktop. The interface opens in your browser
(http://127.0.0.1:8050). The window that opens with it shows the log, and closing it stops the
GUI. Double-clicking again while the GUI runs just reopens it in the browser.

The GUI can also be started from a terminal::

   python -m autoemx.gui path/to/Results

with ``--port 8051`` to use another port and ``--no-browser`` to not open a browser tab.


Step 3 - Choose the results folder
----------------------------------

At the top of the page, choose the **results folder** of your project with **Browse…** (or
type its path). It is the folder containing one sub-folder per sample, as written by the
acquisition (``results_dir`` in the scripts); sub-folders are searched as well. **Rescan**
looks for new samples. The **Sample** menu next to it selects the current sample, shared by
all tabs.


What the GUI can do
-------------------

The GUI has four tabs:

- **Acquisition**: acquire the spectra of a list of samples with the microscope, with every
  option of the acquisition script, and optionally quantify them during acquisition. Use it on
  the microscope computer.
- **Quantification**: quantify the spectra of one or more samples (or only of the samples just
  added to a project), and optionally analyse them right after. It also imports folders of
  spectra acquired without AutoEMX (``.msa``, ``.emsa``, ``.msg``), to quantify and analyse
  them like the others.
- **Analysis**: run the clustering analysis of a sample with every parameter, and explore the
  results: interactive 3D, ternary and 2D plots of the compositions, clusters and candidate
  phases, tables of clusters and spectra, element distributions, the SEM images with the
  position of every spectrum, and the figures saved by the analysis. Click any point to see its
  spectrum, fit it, or find it on the SEM image.
- **Single spectrum**: fit and quantify one spectrum, of a sample or from an exported file, with
  every fitting option, and inspect the fit peak by peak.

To learn how to use them, follow:

- :ref:`gui_comp_analysis_tutorial`: acquisition, quantification and analysis of samples
  (Acquisition, Quantification and Analysis tabs).
- :ref:`gui_fit_spectra_tutorial`: fit and quantify individual spectra, one at a time or in
  batch, from AutoEMX or from other instruments (Single spectrum and Quantification tabs).

Helpful features shared by all tabs:

- **?** next to a parameter shows its description.
- ↺ next to an optional field empties it, i.e. goes back to its default or saved value.
- **Quantifiable elements** (Acquisition and Quantification tabs) shows the periodic table of
  the elements with P/B standards for a microscope and beam energy. Elements without standards
  in your samples are also flagged below the samples table.
- Long tasks (acquisition, quantification, analysis, fits) run in the background, with their
  log and a **Cancel** button; you can keep using the other tabs meanwhile. Only one task
  writing to the samples (acquisition, quantification, analysis, import) runs at a time.
- The Quantification table reads the ledger of every sample; on cloud drives, ledgers not
  stored locally can take a few seconds each to download the first time. Summaries are cached
  in ``~/.autoemx/gui_sample_summaries.json`` and only re-read when a ledger changes.
