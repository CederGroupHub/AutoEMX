Runner: Modify EDS Standards JSON File In-Place

This runner script updates an EDS standards JSON file in place. It supports:
    - Deleting standard entries by ID and el_line (or "all")
    - Excluding entries from mean calculation by ID and el_line (or "all")
    - Recomputing the mean values using only entries with Use_for_mean_calc = True
    - Setting reference_mean to null if no valid entries remain

How to use:
    1. Set the variables at the top of this script (file path, delete/exclude lists).
    2. Run the script directly (as a runner) to apply the changes.
    3. The script prints a summary of all actions taken (deletions, exclusions, means recomputed, etc).

Intended for use as a command-line runner for standards file maintenance and batch updates.
