Automatic element identification
================================

Identifies the elements present in an X-ray spectrum, starting from a (possibly empty) list of
elements known to be present.

Candidates are generated from the X-ray line table and verified through full-spectrum fitting,
starting from the most intense unexplained peak:

1. Fit the spectrum with the elements already in the model (fixed, substrate and identified elements).
2. Search the fit residual for significant peaks with a top-hat filter, which suppresses any locally
   linear mismatch of the background (Statham, Anal. Chem. 49 (1977) 2149).
3. For the most intense unexplained peak, list the elements with a strong line within the detector
   resolution, plus their known overlap partners (common_peak_overlaps.json).
4. Screen the candidates with a filtered weighted least-squares fit of the templates of their line
   families to the residual. Lines of a family have fixed relative weights, so a candidate whose other
   lines are not observed is penalised. If a higher-energy family of the candidate is well excited,
   it must be observed too (confirmation lines; Newbury, Microsc. Microanal. 11 (2005) 545).
5. Verify the best candidates with a full refit. A candidate is accepted if it decreases the chi-square
   of the fit (Poisson variance plus a relative model uncertainty) by more than a threshold, and if the fitted area of its line exceeds the Currie
   detection limit L_D = 2.71 + 3.29 sqrt(B) (Currie, Anal. Chem. 40 (1968) 586).
6. Repeat until no significant peak is left; then remove identified elements that the final fit does
   not need (backward pruning).

This is the iterative qualitative-quantitative strategy of Newbury & Ritchie, Microsc. Microanal.
24 (2018) 350. Statistical tests on nested fits are not strictly valid when the null hypothesis is a
peak area of zero (Protassov et al., ApJ 571 (2002) 545), so all thresholds are empirical.

The fitting is delegated to a callable (see `make_xsp_fit_function`), so the identification loop is
independent of the fitter.

    """
    Thresholds of the element identification.

    Attributes
    ----------
    min_peak_significance : float
        Minimum significance (in standard deviations) of a residual peak, and of the candidate line family
        that explains it.
    low_energy_threshold_keV, low_energy_multiplier : float
        Thresholds are multiplied by `low_energy_multiplier` for lines below `low_energy_threshold_keV`, where
        absorption edges and chemical effects leave structure in the residual.
    element_multipliers : dict
        Threshold multipliers for specific elements (none by default).
    artifact_min_fraction : dict
        Elements also produced by the detector (Si: internal fluorescence of the Si detector, ~0.05% of the counts):
        they are kept only if the fitted area of their main line exceeds this fraction of the total counts.
    candidate_window_sigma : float
        Lines within this many detector sigmas of a residual peak are considered as candidates.
    merged_peak_shift_keV : float
        Extra width of the candidate window, accounting for the shift of the maximum of unresolved
        La+Lb and Ma+Mb peaks from the tabulated energies.
    min_line_weight : float
        Minimum weight of a line (relative to the reference line of its family) to be used to match a peak.
    confirm_overvoltage, confirm_significance : float
        A higher-energy family with overvoltage above `confirm_overvoltage` (default: the overvoltage used by
        XSp_Quantifier to select ideal reference lines, ideal_ref_line_overvoltage) must be observed with at least
        `confirm_significance` standard deviations for a candidate to be accepted.
    model_rel_uncertainty : float
        Relative uncertainty of the spectrum model (peak shapes, line weights, background), added to the
        Poisson variance as (f·model)². Systematic model errors grow with the counts while Poisson noise grows
        with their square root, so without this term every small model imperfection becomes significant in
        high-count (e.g. summed) spectra.
    min_peak_gain : float
        Local fit improvement (decrease of the chi-square within a resolved peak of a candidate) for the peak to
        support the candidate; a decrease of the same amount with the opposite sign makes the peak contradict it.
        A candidate is rejected if any of its resolved peaks predicted above the detection limit contradicts it
        (a peak predicted where there is none), whatever the total fit improvement.
    min_supported_peaks_overlap_check : int
        Minimum number of resolved peaks supporting a candidate found by the overlap check (an element absorbed
        by overlapping peaks must improve the fit at several of its peaks to be told apart from model mismatch).
    min_delta_deviance : float
        Minimum decrease of the fit statistic Σ (y − μ)² / (μ + (f·μ)²) for a candidate to be accepted. In the
        full-fit pruning, an element is also kept if its filtered (peak) gain reaches this value while the total
        statistic still decreases.
    ambiguity_margin : float
        Candidates whose decrease of the fit statistic is within this margin of the best one are reported
        as ambiguous.
    max_full_fits_per_peak : int
        Maximum number of screened candidates verified with a full fit, when full fits are needed (overlaps
        with elements in the model). Otherwise all screened candidates are tested with fast linear fits.
    max_new_elements : int
        Maximum number of identified elements.
    max_iterations : int
        Maximum number of residual peaks examined.
    z_range : (int, int)
        Atomic numbers of the elements proposed as candidates (default B to Bi: all elements above Bi are
        radioactive and essentially absent from samples; use (5, 92) to include Th and U).
    excluded_elements : tuple of str
        Elements never proposed as candidates (default: Tc and Pm, without stable isotopes, and the noble gases
        Ne, Kr, Xe, Rn, absent from solids; Ar is allowed, as it can be implanted by ion milling or sputtering).
    strong_min_filtered_gain : float
        Identified elements are classified as 'strong' (to be added to the fit and quantified) if (1) in the full
        fit without them, at least one of their resolved peaks is a clear positive peak of the filtered residual
        (min_peak_significance, with the threshold multipliers), (2) the chi-square of the top-hat filtered residual
        (insensitive to smooth background changes) improves by at least `strong_min_filtered_gain` when they are
        added, (3) the background is reliable, and (4) no other candidate explains the peak equally well.
        Otherwise they are 'possible' (only reported, for manual checking): e.g. heavy elements whose many weak
        lines fill a background or absorption mismatch, without a peak of their own in the residual.
    background_ratio_bounds, background_bands_keV
        Background health: ratio of data to model in each energy band, in channels without significant peaks
        (excluding fitted peaks and unexplained peaks of the residual). Bands are checked separately, so that a
        wrong background shape (deficit in one band, excess in another) is not averaged out. If a band is outside
        the bounds in the starting fit, the fit is repeated with the background scale K fixed (see
        `background_refit_function` of identify_elements), and the refit is kept if it reduces the worst band
        deviation without creating a background deficit that the starting fit did not have (a model above the
        data is harmless, e.g. when a missing major element changes the background composition). If the data still exceed the model by more than the upper bound in a band (background deficit,
        which any element could fill), also after adding the identified elements (a missing major element changes
        the background too), all identified elements are 'possible'.
    max_start_redchi_fraction : float or None
        If set, the identification is skipped if the reduced chi-square of the starting fit exceeds this fraction
        of the total counts (0.0016 is the criterion of XSp_Quantifier for unreliable fits, quant flag 1). Off by
        default: a missing element also makes the starting fit poor.
    linear_prefilter_fraction : float
        For candidates overlapping peaks of the current fit, the linear test underestimates the fit improvement
        (frozen shapes of the overlapping peaks have partly absorbed the candidate), so it is only used as a
        pre-filter at this fraction of min_delta_deviance; the full fit then applies the threshold.
    contradiction_rel_loss : float
        A predicted peak contradicts a candidate only if the local fit worsens by more than this fraction of the
        candidate's total fit improvement (and by more than min_peak_gain), so that small mismatches of weak lines
        (line weights) do not reject an element with strong evidence elsewhere.
    min_local_gain_fraction : float
        Minimum fraction of the fit improvement brought by a candidate that must come from peak regions (where
        the candidate or other elements have significant peaks), rather than from the background. Rejects elements
        that improve the fit by changing the background (e.g. a heavy element rescuing a fit stuck with too little
        background), rather than by explaining peaks.
    prune : bool
        Whether to remove identified elements that the final fit does not need. Uses full fits (one with all
        identified elements, one without each of them), run only if elements were identified.
    overlap_check : bool
        Whether to test the overlap partners (overlap table) of the elements in the model, even without residual
        peaks: an element whose peaks are absorbed by overlapping peaks of other elements leaves no residual
        peak, but still improves the fit. Partners are tested with linear fits (tied shifts); the best one
        passing the thresholds is confirmed with a full fit, and the check is repeated until none is confirmed.
    full_fit_overlaps : bool
        Whether candidates overlapping peaks of the current fit are tested with full fits instead of linear
        fits (in both cases, with energy shifts tied to the overlapping peaks).
    refit_after_accept : bool
        Whether to confirm each element accepted with a linear test by a full fit, so that the next residual
        peaks are searched with the fitter's peak shapes. Needed for high-count spectra, where the mismatch
        of the linear templates becomes significant; off by default for single spectra.
    final_fit : bool
        Whether the final model must come from a full fit. Off by default, since the caller refits anyway
        with the identified elements (e.g. quantification after the identification of missing elements).

    spectrum_vals, energy_vals : array

    fit_function : callable
        Takes a list of sample elements and returns a FitOutcome of the spectrum fitted with those elements
        (substrate elements are handled by the fit function). See `make_xsp_fit_function`.
    beam_energy : float
        Beam energy (keV).
    sigma_fn : callable
        Detector sigma (keV) as a function of energy (keV). See `get_sigma_function`.
    fixed_elements : list of str
        Elements known to be present. May be empty: the peaks of the raw spectrum are then assigned first
        (see `_assign_peaks`), and the starting fit includes the assigned elements, which are verified like
        the other identified elements.
    substrate_elements : list of str
        Substrate elements, always part of the model. Their peaks cannot be attributed to the sample.
    settings : PeakIDSettings, optional
        Identification thresholds.
    has_standard : callable, optional
        Returns whether an element can be quantified. Used only for reporting.
    excluded_elements : iterable of str
        Elements never proposed (in addition to settings.excluded_elements).
    initial_outcome : FitOutcome, optional
        Fit of the spectrum with the fixed elements, if already available.
    background_refit_function : callable, optional
        Fit function with the background scale fixed (e.g. make_xsp_fit_function with fixed_par_vals={'K': K},
        K from the fit above 5 keV). Used instead of `fit_function` if the background of the starting fit is
        outside settings.background_ratio_bounds.
    priority_elements : iterable of str
        Pool of elements likely to be present (e.g. identified in other spectra of the same sample).
        For each residual peak, pool elements that pass the screening are verified first, and the other
        candidates are fitted only if no pool element explains the peak. This saves full fits, at the cost
        of a bias towards the pool for overlapping candidates.
