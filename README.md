**Automated Electron Microscopy X-Ray Spectroscopy for Compositional Characterization of Materials**

</div>

AutoEMXSp is a **fully automated framework** for SEM-EDS workflows — from spectral acquisition and quantification to data filtering and compositional analysis — all in **one click**.

📖 This work is described in:  
A. Giunto *et al.*, *Harnessing Automated SEM-EDS and Machine Learning to Unlock High-Throughput Compositional Characterization of Powder Materials*, 2025.  
DOI: [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7837297/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7837297/v1)

### ✨ Key Features
- **Automated acquisition & quantification** of X-ray spectra using the peak-to-background method. Single spectrum quantification also available
- **Automated rule-based filtering** of compositions to discard poorly quantified spectra from the analysis
- **Automated machine learning–based compositional analysis** to identify the compositions of individual phases in the sample  
- **Automated experimental standard collection** scripts included
- **Extensible architecture** — adaptable to other techniques such as  
  - Wavelength Dispersive Spectroscopy (WDS)  
  - Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) with EDS  
- **Extensible hardware support** — includes driver for ThermoFisher Phenom Desktop SEM series, and can be extended to any electron microscope with a Python API  

### 📊 Performance
- **Benchmarked** on 74 single-phase samples with compositions spanning **38 elements** (from nitrogen to bismuth), it achieved **<5–10% relative deviation** from expected values  
- **Machine learning** compositional analysis detects individual phase composition in **multi-phase samples**, including minor phases
- **Intermixed phases** can also be resolved

### 🧪 Supported Use Cases
- Powder, bulk, and rough samples  
- Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS)  

### ⚙️ Requirements
- Cross-platform: runs on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**
- Quick installation

## 🚀 Installation

You can install **AutoEMXSp** in just one command.

### Using pip
```bash
pip install autoemxsp
```

### Or directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CederGroupHub/AutoEMXSp
```

---

## 🖥 Quick Start

AutoEMXSp supports three main automated workflows:

1. **Experimental Standard Collection** — acquire and fit X-ray spectra from known-composition samples to generate reference peak-to-background ratios.
2. **Sample Acquisition & Analysis** — acquire spectra from unknown samples, quantify them, and perform compositional phase analysis.
3. **Particle Size Statistical Analysis** -  search for particles and collect statistics on their size distribution.

---

### 1️⃣ Acquire Experimental Standards
See **Run_Experimental_Standard_Collection.py** script

```python
from autoemxsp.runners import batch_acquire_experimental_stds

# Define standards(s) to analyse (additional options available):
# - 'ID': unique standard identifier
# - 'formula': standard composition
# - 'pos': stage position (x, y) in mm
# - 'sample_type': bulk or powder
# - 'is_manual_meas': Manually select spots if standard is not bulk, nor powder

std_list = [
    {
        'id': 'Al_std',
        'formula': 'Al',
        'pos': (0, 0),
        'sample_type': 'bulk',
        'is_manual_meas': False
    },
]

# Run experimental standard acquisition at the microscope computer
batch_acquire_experimental_stds(stds=std_list)
```

### 2️⃣ Acquire & Analyse Samples
See **Run_Acquisition_Quant_Analysis.py** script

```python
from autoemxsp.runners import batch_acquire_and_analyze

# Define sample(s) to analyse (additional options available):
# - 'id': unique sample identifier
# - 'els': list of possible elements in the sample
# - 'pos': stage position (x, y) in mm
# - 'cnd' (optional): list of candidate phases/formulas

samples = [
    {
        'id': 'Anorthite_mineral',
        'els': ['Ca', 'Al', 'Si', 'O'],
        'pos': (-37.5, -37.5),
        'cnd': ['CaAl2Si2O8']
    },
]

# Run acquisition and analysis at the microscope computer
batch_acquire_and_analyze(samples)
```


### 3️⃣ Particle Size Statistical Analysis
See **Collect_Particle_Statistics.py** script

```python
from autoemxsp.runners import collect_particle_statistics

# Define sample(s) to analyse (additional options available):
# - 'id': unique sample identifier
# - 'pos': stage position (x, y) in mm

samples = [
    {
        'id': 'Anorthite_mineral',
        'pos': (-37.5, -37.5),
    },
]

# Run acquisition and analysis at the microscope computer
collect_particle_statistics(samples)
```

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.11 or newer**  
- All dependencies are installed automatically via `pip` or `conda`.  
- Tested versions of dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml`.  
  > The package **may work** with more recent versions, but these have **not been tested**.

### Electron Microscope Support
- ✅ Developed and tested for **Thermo Fisher Phenom Desktop SEMs**.  
- ✅ Compatible with any Phenom microscope equipped with **PPI (Phenom Programming Interface)**.  
- ⚠️ For other microscope models, the driver must be adapted to the appropriate API commands.

## 🆕 Coming Soon
Here’s what’s planned for future releases of **AutoEMXSp**:
- 🐍 Verify with the latest **Python** version for improved compatibility with current scientific libraries
- 📏 New scripts for **spectral parameter calibration** to extend the `XSp_calibs` library to your own instrument.
- 🤖 Integration of ML models for particle segmentation and improved size distribution analysis
